First install Cheat Engine:
Download Cheat Engine -> Add installer to Steam -> Use compatability tool (chose whatever proton version you want) -> Run the installer and finish the install.

### Install protonhax: ###
yay -S protonhax

### You will need to add to all games you want to use Cheat Engine on the following Launch option: ###
protonhax init %COMMAND%

### Create a file cheatengine-protonhax.desktop in patch ~/.local/share/applications/ and open it in a text editor, I use vim so command would be in my case: ### 
vim ~/.local/share/applications/cheatengine-protonhax.desktop

### In the editor paste the following and save: ###
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Cheat Engine (Protonhax)
Exec=sh -c 'protonhax run "$(protonhax ls)" "$(find /* -type f -name 'cheatengine-x86_64.exe')"'
Terminal=false
Categories=Game;

### Now you have an Cheat Engine (Protonhax) Application in the start meniu, you can add it to task bar or desktop by right click and choosing the option ###
### Keep in mind that it will only run if you have the game open and the game has protonhax init %COMMAND% as a Launch option ###
